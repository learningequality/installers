README for KA Lite Mac OS X Application
=======================================

This is the [KA Lite](https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/) application that sits on the menu bar of Mac OS X.

It is used to control and monitor the [KA Lite](https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite/) server by [Foundation for Learning Equality](https://learningequality.org/).

It uses [PyRun](http://www.egenix.com/products/python/PyRun/) to isolate the KA Lite environment from your system's [Python](https://www.python.org/) application.


## Install KA Lite

1. Download the [KA Lite Mac OS X Installer for 0.16](http://pantry.learningequality.org/downloads/ka-lite/0.16/installers/mac/).
1. Double-click the downloaded `KA-Lite.pkg` package and follow the setup wizard.  The installation requires admin privileges.
1. The installer will create the `/Applications/KA-Lite/` folder that contains the KA-Lite application, uninstaller tool, licence, readme, and release notes documents.
1. The install process is quite lengthy because the installer had to copy assessment items and run some management commands including the setup process.  Please be patient.

**Note:** A computer restart is needed to complete the installation.


## Using the KA Lite OS X Application


### To start the KA Lite server

1. Launch `KA-Lite` from the `/Applications/KA-Lite/` folder.
1. Click the `KA-Lite` icon in the menu bar and select the `Start KA Lite` menu option.
1. When prompted that KA Lite has been started, click on the icon again and select the `Open in Browser` menu option - this should launch KA Lite in your preferred web browser.


### Menu Options

1. `Start KA Lite` - Starts the KA Lite web server.
1. `Stop KA Lite` - Stops the KA Lite web server.  This is available when the KA Lite server has started.
1. `Open in Browser` - Opens the installed KA Lite web app using your preferred web browser, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8008`.  This is available when the KA Lite server has started.
1. `Preferences` - Opens the preferences window where you can customize the KA Lite data folder, view application logs in the `Logs` tab, or uninstall KA Lite.
1. `Quit` - Stops the KA Lite web server and closes the application.

### How to set a custom KA Lite data folder:

 1. Stop the KA Lite server from running.
 2. Set your custom KA Lite data folder in the `Preferences` dialog.
 3. Click `Apply`.  This will update the `KALITE_HOME` environment variable.
 4. Launch a new Terminal session to use the updated `KALITE_HOME` environment variable.
 5. Run `kalite manage syncdb --noinput`.
 6. Run `kalite manage init_content_items --overwrite`.
 7. Run `kalite manage unpack_assessment_zip /Users/Shared/ka-lite/assessment/assessment.zip`.
 8. Run `kalite manage setup --noinput`.
 9. Start the server again by clicking on `Start KA Lite` in the menu option.

**Note:** You can specify another assessment items archive that you've downloaded at the `unpack_assessment_zip` step above.  Make sure you use the archive for the installed version of KA Lite.


## Uninstall KA Lite

* This will require admin privileges.
* Double-click the `/Applications/KA-Lite/KA-Lite_Uninstall.tool`, this is a bash script that will do the following:
  - uninstall `KA-Lite.app` and remove its dependencies, then unset the environment variables.
  - optionally remove the KA Lite data folder.
