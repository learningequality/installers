KA Lite Installer for Windows
==========

This project provides a smoother way to install and run KA Lite in a Windows Machine.

---
#### This project was built using the following software:
* Inno Setup 5.5.3 [Download] (http://files.jrsoftware.org/is/5/)
* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 [Website] (https://www.visualstudio.com/)
* Git (note: install with the option to place the `git` executable in the path, so it can be run within `cmd`)

---
#### Instructions to build the GUI:
* Open `gui-source/KA Lite.sln` using Visual Studio.
* Click on the "Build" menu and then choose the "Build Solution" option.
* Copy the resulting `KA Lite.exe` from its output location to `gui-packed/KA Lite.exe`

Note: If you have made no changes to `gui-source`, you don't have to build `KA Lite.exe`. Just use the version in this repo.

Note: If you *do* make changes to anything in `gui-source`, be sure to build and commit `KA Lite.exe`.

#### Instructions to build "KALiteSetup.exe":
To build in Linux, first install `wine`. These directions assume you're building on Windows -- if not, you can 
skip using msys and use bash instead.

* Clone this repository;
* Download ka-lite-static sdist whl file from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ka-lite-static/ to this directory.
* Download and rename the English content pack from `en.zip` to `contentpack-0.17.en.zip` to this directory. Look for it in [the pantry](http://pantry.learningequality.org/downloads/)
* Set the environment variable KALITE_BUILD_VERSION to the desired version for the installer, e.g. `0.16.0`.
  This should match the version in the sdist *exactly*, so `ka-lite-static-0.17.3` means that `KALITE_BUILD_VERSION`
  should have the value `0.17.3`.
* In Windows, run the following command from this directory:
```
> make.vbs
```
* In Linux, run the following command in this directory using `wine`:
```bash
> wine inno-compiler/ISCC.exe installer-source/KaliteSetupScript.iss
```
* The output file named "KALiteSetup-X.X.X.exe" will appear within this project folder.
* Party on, Garth.

#### Node on Windows
Get [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). It should add the `node` and `npm` binaries to your path.

You'll need both `git` and `make` in your PATH to get all the dependencies from npm.
You can get `make` (and many other GNU utilities) with [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).
Install it, and then in the `C:\MinGW\bin` directory (or wherever you installed it) you'll find `mingw32-make.exe`.
Make a copy of that file called `make.exe`, and add its directory to your path.

Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
Install it and add `c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin` (or wherever you installed it) to your path.

After adding both binaries to your path, you're ready to run `npm install` in the `ka-lite` directory.

---
#### To clone ka-lite and this repository, run the following lines:
* git clone https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite.git
* git clone https://github.com/learningequality/installers.git

### Build server instructions
Our bamboo build server basically follows the above instructions. The primary difference is that instead of getting
a KA Lite sdist from PyPI, we build it ourselves in .whl format instead of .tar.gz format, using the following
make directive in the ka-lite base directory:

```
> make dist
```

Additionally, you *must* update the value of the `KALITE_BUILD_VERSION` environment variable that the build server
uses, as described above.
This can be configured from bamboo, which allows you to set env variable values on a per-task basis.

### Signing the installer
In this directory you'll find a simple script called `sign_script.bat`.
That script is a template -- it is not functional!
Once you obtain our certificates and the necessary passwords, you can substitute them into that script in order to 
sign the installer for release.
