KA Lite Installer for Windows
==========

This project provides a smoother way to install and run KA Lite in a Windows Machine.

---
#### This project was built using the following software:
* Inno Setup 5.5.3 [Download] (http://files.jrsoftware.org/is/5/)
* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 [Website] (https://www.visualstudio.com/)
* Git (note: install with the option to place the `git` executable in the path, so it can be run within `cmd`)

---
#### Instructions to build the GUI:
* Open `gui-source/KA Lite.sln` using Visual Studio.
* Click on the "Build" menu and then choose the "Build Solution" option.
* Copy the resulting `KA Lite.exe` from its output location to `gui-packed/KA Lite.exe`

Note: If you have made no changes to `gui-source`, you don't have to build `KA Lite.exe`. Just use the version in this repo.

Note: If you *do* make changes to anything in `gui-source`, be sure to build and commit `KA Lite.exe`.

#### Instructions to build "KALiteSetup.exe":
To build in Linux, first install `wine`.
* Clone this repository;
* Copy `ka-lite` folder from KA Lite's repository, to the root of this repository;
* Ensure the assessment items have been unpacked in the `ka-lite` directory.
* Follow the _Instructions to download pip dependency zip files_ above
* Create an empty db for distribution as per the section _Creating an Empty DB_
* Run `kalite manage collectstatic` to create the `ka-lite/static-libraries` directory; this is a work-around until the windows installer uses setuptools.
* Run `npm install` in the `ka-lite` directory to get node dependencies. This will create a `node_modules` subdirectory. (See the section *Node on Windows*.)
* Run `node build.js` to build js bundle modules -- this is distinct from the `collectstatic` step.
* Then remove the `node_modules` subdirectory. It causes an error with Inno Setup.
* Run the `compileymltojson` management command.
* Include built documentation in the appropriate directory -- `docs\_build\html`, but this can be configured. See `STATICFILES_DIRS` setting.
* Delete `secretkey.txt` from `kalite` directory.
* In Windows, run the following command from this directory:
```
> make.vbs
```
* In Linux, run the following command in this directory using `wine`:
```bash
> wine inno-compiler/ISCC.exe installer-source/KaliteSetupScript.iss
```
* The output file named "KALiteSetup-X.X.X.exe" will appear within this project folder.

#### Node on Windows
Get [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). It should add the `node` and `npm` binaries to your path.

You'll need both `git` and `make` in your PATH to get all the dependencies from npm.
You can get `make` (and many other GNU utilities) with [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).
Install it, and then in the `C:\MinGW\bin` directory (or wherever you installed it) you'll find `mingw32-make.exe`.
Make a copy of that file called `make.exe`, and add its directory to your path.

Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
Install it and add `c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin` (or wherever you installed it) to your path.

After adding both binaries to your path, you're ready to run `npm install` in the `ka-lite` directory.

#### Instructions to download pip dependency zip files
* Clone the `ka-lite` repository.
* Clone this repository.
* Install `python-2.7.10.msi` at `/installer/windows/python-setup` directory.
* Make sure `python.exe` is in your path, or you will have to invoke it using an absolute path below.
* On your command line navigate to `ka-lite` directory that contain `setup.py`.
* Run this command `python.exe setup.py sdist --static` to download zip files .

On Linux, ensure you have python 2.7 installed, then:
* On your command line navigate to `ka-lite` directory that contain `setup.py`.
* Run this command `python setup.py sdist --static` to download zip files .

---
#### Creating an Empty DB
After installing `ka-lite`:
* Ensure the file `ka-lite/kalite/database/data.sqlite` doesn't already exist.
* Run the command `kalite manage syncdb`. You will see this prompt:

    You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have any superusers defined.
    Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):

* Choose "no".
* Run the command `kalite manage migrate`.
* This should create the file `ka-lite/kalite/database/data.sqlite`, which will be copied to the target system by the installer.

#### To clone ka-lite and this repository, run the following lines:
